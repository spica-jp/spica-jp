# About Me
I am a second-year master's student at a national university in Japan, pursuing a degree in science and technology. My specialization is medical imaging technology, with a focus on CT, image reconstruction, and deep learning.

I have a deep passion for **LaTeX** and primarily use **C, C++, and Python** in my work. Additionally, I write shell scripts and am currently studying Rust, Ruby, expl3, and HTML/CSS to expand my skill set.
